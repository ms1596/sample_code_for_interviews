// identifying problems of stack

1)Obviously the question will mostly involve arrays. Majorly, not always.
2) The question can of strings, linklist, trees also where stack can optimize the solution, but Majorly
ques will be of array.
3) If the brute force solution is of TC => O(n^2) and inner loop is dependent on outer loop. Inner loop is a function of the outer loop.
ex => 
for(int i = 0; i<n; ++i)
 for(int j=0; j<i; ++j)
  
  So here j is dependent on i.
  Similarly inner loop can of these forms also
  j -> 0 to i j++
  j -> i to 0 j--
  j -> i to n j++

If these are the conditions of the problems, there is a very high chance that the problem will be optimized using stack concept
